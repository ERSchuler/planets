Cold and dry... don't drink the water... everything is red, my favorite color... 
don't blink!!!
There are two moons that may be a problem for wolf man... I drank the water.. oh 
no... the fear... the horror... Cthulhu comes..
But the mummy will apprecaite the lack of humidity... i hear the footsteps.. closer 
and closer... Cthulu has arrived...
